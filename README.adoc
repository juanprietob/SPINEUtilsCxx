= SPINEUtilsCXX

== Description 

This project has some of the back-end programs and utilities for SPINE

You can find the following utilities:

. SPINE contour manipulation.
.. ContoursIO: read, write.
.. Contour interpolation: bezier interpolation.
.. Contour values: area and perimeter calculation.

. Contour statistics:

. Image manipulation:
.. Resampling: Image ares converted from DICOM or nifti to RAS space.

== Build

You will need g++ v4.x.

If you have another version install (let's say v5), use `update-alternatives` to switch version easily:

```
sudo apt-get install g++-4.8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 10
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-5 5
```

By default, you will now use g++ 4.8. If you would like to switch, run `sudo update-alternatives --config g++`.

== Requirements:
ITK, VTK, Xerces, CMake, json-c, gdcm

ITK option for 'support version 3' must be on -> ITKV3_COMPATIBILITY ON

=== GDCM

To install GDCM please download the sources from the link:https://github.com/juanprietob/GDCM.git[git] repository 

This program will dump the header of a DICOM file in JSON format. 
It is more robust than the pydicom version used before. 
GDCM is also used for image anonymization.

Turn on the following variables when executing CMAKE for GDCM. Select 'Show advance settings' for some of these variables. 

[source, CMAKE]
----
GDCM_BUILD_APPLICATIONS ON

GDCM_USE_SYSTEM_OPENSSL ON
----

Compile and install GDCM.
